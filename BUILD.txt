Building the Fonts
------------------
To bootstrap the project, type:

templates/build DB.cfg

then use make and try the following targets:

make all
make dist
make exe
make zip
make clean
make dist-clean
make extra-clean

Distributors please note that only the fonts in the top level directory should be installed.  The fonts in the font-source directory do not have the Graphite rules needed for correct rendering.

Note:
If you modify DB.cfg or any file under templates/, make sure you save it with EOL in Unix format.
